# Hunger-Games-Software-Academy
Only the strong survive

It's just the front end static website for now.
for a look at the site;  https://the-chosen-3rd.github.io/Hunger-Games-Software-Academy/  
(Launched on github pages for now).


A fully responsive front end, built using bootstrap. Parts of the front end are still under construction, 


The backend is also currently being developed. I will be building a REST API via django and python, 
along with a postGRES database,


Still very much a work in progress

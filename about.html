                        <p class="m-0"> I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I decided to join HGSA. 
                            My older brother died trying to become a software dev, There was no choice, 
                            I had to grow up quick if I was going to survive. </p>

                        <p class="m-0"> I'm a slow learner, I spent the first few months in gladiator cages, This bootcamp was so intense,
                            Those of us who could not connect a restAPI to a postGRES database, were forced into brutal and bloody combat just to 
                            retain our spot within the program. This was me celebrating after building my very first web page.</p>

                        <p class="m-0"> It's been almost 10 years since joining HSGA, and you can really see how much I've matured. 
                            I was recently hired by a company offering me $30K a year to start. With 250K in debt to HGSA, 
                            I can afford a small room above a bowling alley, And meals deals once a week at Mcdonalds Thanks HSGA</p>
